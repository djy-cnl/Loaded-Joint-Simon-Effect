<p><b>Participants</b>&nbsp; Sixty four right-handed undergraduate students participated for course credit or payment. Half of them were randomly assigned to the low-load group and the other half were to the high-load group. Two participants in the high-load group did not press the response keys strongly enough, and about 80% of their responses were not collected. They were replaced with two newly recruited participants. All participants did not notice the purpose and hypothesis of the experiment until debriefing.<br></p>
